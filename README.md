# Credit-card-detection#

This project uses **supervised machine learning** to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from an **imbalanced dataset** of over 284,000 records. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train a **Random Forest classifier**, with performance evaluated using relevant metrics like ROC-AUC and confusion matrix.

- **Accuracy**: ~99.9% (but misleading due to imbalance)
- **Precision (fraud class)**: ~84%
- **Recall (fraud class)**: ~76%
- **F1-score (fraud class)**: ~80%
- **ROC-AUC**: ~0.97

‚ö†Ô∏è This highlights that traditional accuracy is not reliable for imbalanced datasets.
